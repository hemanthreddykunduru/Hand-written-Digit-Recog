In i.pynb file 
i just used --> Goolge Colab "/content/recog_imgs/7.png" as a directed path 
in Google Colab folder "content" is by default get created automatically

So directed path is your wish,while running code make sure that you must make save the model pics in Google colab

if you use --> jupyter notebook it will be different path for it, like "C:/Users/heman/Downloads/Hand-written-Digit-Recog/recog_imgs/7.png"
